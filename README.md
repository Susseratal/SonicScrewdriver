# A Sonic Screwdriver?  
Well sort of. This is based on the Adafruit TB-B-Gone [(Github)](https://github.com/adafruit/TV-B-Gone-kit) [(website)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/73) which is a very cool design. I simply intend to modify it slightly to also light up an LED, make a buzzing noise and fit inside a little chassis.  

## Can I get one?  
No, but once I've finished the project (and I'll hopefully mark this readme as such) you can build your own from the files, as I'll make sure the PCB and models for the case are all freely available.
